# Events Reference

Events are scripts triggered by the app manager to control apps programmatically.  
All account passwords are garbage values — authentication is handled exclusively via tokens through the reverse proxy.

## Setup Events

Run once at installation time to configure apps so they integrate cleanly into the ecosystem without any manual setup by the user.

### `setup`
Performs the initial server configuration (creating "root" account, complete setup, changing configurations...)

---

## Account Management Events

### `create_account`
Creates a new user with a randomly generated garbage password. The account is not usable via password login by design, access is only possible through a valid token. Returns the internal app user ID.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |

### `delete_account`
Permanently deletes a user and all their data. Should be preceded by `revoke_all_tokens` to cleanly invalidate any active sessions before removal.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |

### `disable_account`
Locks a user account without deleting it. The user's data is preserved but all their tokens stop working immediately. Useful for temporary suspension.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |

### `enable_account`
Re-enables a previously disabled account. Does not restore old tokens, a new token must be generated separately via `generate_token`.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |

## Token Management Events

### `generate_token`
Creates a new API token for a user and returns it. The token is what the reverse proxy stores and injects into requests on behalf of the user. The generated token should be stored securely, it cannot be retrieved again after creation.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |
| `label` | string | ❌ (defaults to `"managed"`) |

### `revoke_token`
Deletes a specific token. Use this when rotating or when a single token is suspected to be compromised.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |
| `token` | secret | ✅ |

### `revoke_all_tokens`
Deletes every active token for a user in one operation. Use before `delete_account`, or when a user's access needs to be fully cut immediately.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |

### `verify_token`
Checks whether a token is valid and returns the associated username. Used by the reverse proxy or the app manager to validate an existing token before trusting it.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `token` | secret | ✅ |

### `rotate_token`
Atomically generates a new token and revokes the old one. This is the standard operation for periodic credential refresh. It ensures there is no window where the user has no valid token or two valid tokens at once.

| Arg | Type | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | string | ✅ |
| `old_token` | secret | ✅ |
